Wow, it's been a while since I've even thought about this. Having a one year old leaves very little time to do much at all. Well, I could, but most night I'd rather watch TV with Kaci and catch up on all our TV shows. 

But, I have been playing with my Raspberry Pi quite a bit, that was until Ayden spilled milk on it a day before my case came in! Grr... So it was down for a couple weeks while I decided what I wanted to get. I found an awesome deal, $33 flat, on a Raspberry Pi 3! Couldn't pass it up. 

Now we're back, rocking Kodi 16.1 on a custom OSMC build. 

But through all this time, sadly I lost my domain name! I forgot to scoop it back up and some Malaysian business bought it, and to get it back would be more than I'm willing to pay for. 

So I decided I'll just use the github.io address for now, not like anyone really reads this anyway, it's more for just me. But whatever. I hit some snags upon transitioning back to the github.io address since _config.yml wasn't set with the correct baseurl, actually wasn't set with one at all. Got it fixed. Got it running. This is basically a test to make sure my backend admin page still works.

	<div class="entry"><p>Our day started pretty early, actually it started yesterday when we first arrived at the hospital around 9pm.
Kaci's water broke around 8:30pm and we loaded up and headed to the hospital! From then on it was a waiting game,
which seemed to progress very slowly. Until around 3:45am when the contractions started coming pretty quickly. A
little after 4am she started pushing! After a very short labor period and one tired mommy later Ayden Beckett Roy
entered into this world at 4:36am on March 17th, 2015 at an even 7 pounds!</p>

	<div class="entry"><p>We went to the hospital Saturday morning around 6am. Her mucus plug had come out.</p>

<p>No problems on Sunday.</p>

<p>Today, Kaci got ready and went to work as usual. She left work around 10am due to cramps and contractions. They started get worse around 5pm. I left work after closing the store at 7:30 and got stuck in some road work traffic on 75 north. Finally get home and leave again shortly after to fill her car up with gas and clean it out. Not five minutes later, her mom calls and tells me Kaci's water just broke!</p>

<p>So after the pump finished I hurried home and loaded the car with our packed bags, car seat, and wife!</p>

<p>We've now been at the hospital for two hours, and she's gotten her epidural already. Now we just wait for little man to join us! He's going to be a leprechaun!</p>

She was last seen in the Ooltewah, TN area behind the post office around 4:00 pm.

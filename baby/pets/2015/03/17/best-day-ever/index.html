		<p>Our day started pretty early, actually it started yesterday when we first arrived at the hospital around 9pm.
Kaci's water broke around 8:30pm and we loaded up and headed to the hospital! From then on it was a waiting game,
which seemed to progress very slowly. Until around 3:45am when the contractions started coming pretty quickly. A
little after 4am she started pushing! After a very short labor period and one tired mommy later Ayden Beckett Roy
entered into this world at 4:36am on March 17th, 2015 at an even 7 pounds!</p>

<p>Things only got better from there! After getting to meet our new son for about an hour
they took him to the nursery to get cleaned up and checked out. That lasted between 2 and 3 hours,
which gave us some time get finally get a little sleep! When they brought him back to us we
were able to really get some long awaited one-on-one time with him! Then the visitors began rolling in!</p>

<p>Shortly after 9am Kaci received a call from our neighbors next door. He asked if we were at home, which she replied,
"No, we're actually at the hospital - i just gave birth to our son!" He was all excited, and then dropped a bomb on us.
"Well, your other new addition has come home." What? Mieka was home? No way! I didn't even have to hear the conversation
to know exactly what was being said just by Kaci's facial expressions! I kissed my wife, and kissed my new son, and took off
to the house.</p>

<p>All the way home, I was worried that maybe it wasn't really her. That maybe since we weren't home, and she couldn't get
into the backyard that she might run off again. But no. I pulled up and there she was! Almost five days after basically
dissappearing from our backyard, our little girl was finally home! Days of worrying immediately fell off. I jumped out
of the car, and she basically jumped into my arms!</p>

<p>Her tags were missing, and her collar was torn up a bit, but other than that she looked exactly the way she did Thursday
morning before I left for work. I fed her and GiGi, but given it was pretty early picky old GiGi didn't want her food.
Mieka did though! She scarffed down her's and then GiGi's too! I took them out back so GiGi could relieve herself, and
Mieka stayed right by my side, not even wanting to step off the deck. I noticed she had some blood on her bad paw and
upon closer inspection her pad on that paw looked like it was rubbed raw. This leads me to believe that someone did not
take her, but that she really had just wandered off and gotten lost and finally trekked her way back to her home!</p>

<p>It was hard leaving, but as soon as I took them back inside Mieka went straight to her crate with her treat and curled up
for some much needed rest. I returned to the hospital, and we began updating everyone on our second big news for the day!
Everyone was shocked and in disbelief! Totally amazing!</p>

<p>We received visitors all day, including many nurses and doctors, and we ended up with a perfectly happy and healthy
7 pounds 19.5 inches baby boy named Ayden Beckett Roy! Around 9:30 after all the visitors had left for the night, I went
back home to check on the girls, and cat, and grab a couple of forgotten items. They were all fine and super excited to
see me! Bailey, my sister, is staying at the house to keep the girls, mainly Mieka, company and the cat, Vinny, too!</p>

<p>I'm back at the hospital now watching my beautiful son sleep. I could not have asked for a better day! Thank you all who
have helped us through our first pregnancy and also to all of our friends and family who have helped us these past five days
since Mieka went missing.</p>

<p>We got lucky on this perfect St. Patrick's Day of 2015!</p>

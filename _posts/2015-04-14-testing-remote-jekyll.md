Testing my very basic content management system for my Jekyll powered blog hosted by Github Pages. 

My Jekyll blog is generated on my machine, and then the generated site is pushed to my Github repo on the `gh-pages` branch via a `rake` task. 

A separate task is also available to push the source to the `master` branch.

My basic CMS is powered by PHP from my home server and is accessible from anywhere I have internet! 

Testing save to drafts -> posts -> publish

Ran into some issues, hopefully this all works now.

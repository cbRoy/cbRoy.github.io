Testing my very basic content management system for my Jekyll powered blog hosted by Github Pages. 

My Jekyll blog is generated on my machine, and then the source and generated site is pushed to my Github repo on the `master` and `gh-pages` via `rake`. 

My basic CMS is powered by PHP from my home server and is accessible from anywhere I have internet! 

Testing save(to drafts, then move to posts, and then finally publish)

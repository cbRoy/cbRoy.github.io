We went to the hospital Saturday morning around 6am. Her mucus plug had come out. 

No problems on Sunday.

Today, Kaci got ready and went to work as usual. She left work around 10am due to cramps and contractions. They started get worse around 5pm. I left work after closing the store at 7:30 and got stuck in some road work traffic on 75 north. Finally get home and leave again shortly after to fill her car up with gas and clean it out. Not five minutes later, her mom calls and tells me Kaci's water just broke! 

So after the pump finished I hurried home and loaded the car with our packed bags, car seat, and wife! 

We've now been at the hospital for two hours, and she's gotten her epidural already. Now we just wait for little man to join us! He's going to be a leprechaun!

So we took little man to his first month check up this morning. He is 9 pounds 2 ounces and 20.5 inches long, or tall, I don't know what you classify a baby's length as yet... either way he is about 2 pounds bigger and about an inch longer than he was when he was born. 

The doctor said Ayden is exactly where he is supposed to be and that he looks perfectly fine! Woohoo!

We have been dealing with some pretty bad monkey butt, but we are starting to get it under control and it's looking much better! It has gone from big, raised, red spots to almost nothing now! The secret: butt cream mixed with a liquid antacid! 

He is still a little fussy and the doctor said it is probably due to reflux, so starting today we've been giving him baby Zantac. No updates on whether that's the case or if that's working yet, but we'll see! 

He's a bundle of joy that we're more than excited to have! Yes it's a burden, but one that neither of us cares to carry!

Mieka has been missing since Thursday, March 12th, 2015. 
She was last seen in the Ooltewah, TN area behind the post office around 4:00 pm.
If you've seen her or know anything about where she could be, please contact me. 
My wife and I miss her very much, as does our other dog and cat. 

Thank you.

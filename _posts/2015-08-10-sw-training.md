This is going to be a tough week. I'll be in Atlanta for Sherwin-Williams Assistant Manager Training all week while my family is at home alone without me. It'll be the first time I'll be away from Ayden for any extended amount of time, as well as Kaci. We haven't really been apart this long in almost five years! It will most likely go by fairly quickly for me, at least during the day, because I'll be pretty busy, but I know it is going to be tough for her and him. During the day might not be so bad for them since I'm usually at work, but at night I can imagine it is going to be rough for both of us, but mainly her. I hate that I have to be here and away from my family for a week and all for nothing. I'm not getting anything for doing this. I won't come home getting a raise for having completed this session. I won't come home any smarter or knowledgeable for having gone through this training exercise. This will benefit me very little and hurt my family greatly while I'm gone. So close to home, but so far away.

I miss you guys already. I LOVE YOU!

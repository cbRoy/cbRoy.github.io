	<div class="entry"><p>This is going to be a tough week. I'll be in Atlanta for Sherwin-Williams Assistant Manager Training all week while my family is at home alone without me. It'll be the first time I'll be away from Ayden for any extended amount of time, as well as Kaci. We haven't really been apart this long in almost five years! It will most likely go by fairly quickly for me, at least during the day, because I'll be pretty busy, but I know it is going to be tough for her and him. During the day might not be so bad for them since I'm usually at work, but at night I can imagine it is going to be rough for both of us, but mainly her. I hate that I have to be here and away from my family for a week and all for nothing. I'm not getting anything for doing this. I won't come home getting a raise for having completed this session. I won't come home any smarter or knowledgeable for having gone through this training exercise. This will benefit me very little and hurt my family greatly while I'm gone. So close to home, but so far away.</p>

<p>I miss you guys already. I LOVE YOU!</p>

	<div class="entry"><p>So we took little man to his first month check up this morning. He is 9 pounds 2 ounces and 20.5 inches long, or tall, I don't know what you classify a baby's length as yet... either way he is about 2 pounds bigger and about an inch longer than he was when he was born.</p>

<p>The doctor said Ayden is exactly where he is supposed to be and that he looks perfectly fine! Woohoo!</p>

<p>We have been dealing with some pretty bad monkey butt, but we are starting to get it under control and it's looking much better! It has gone from big, raised, red spots to almost nothing now! The secret: butt cream mixed with a liquid antacid!</p>

<p>He is still a little fussy and the doctor said it is probably due to reflux, so starting today we've been giving him baby Zantac. No updates on whether that's the case or if that's working yet, but we'll see!</p>

<p>He's a bundle of joy that we're more than excited to have! Yes it's a burden, but one that neither of us cares to carry!</p>

	<div class="entry"><p>Testing my very basic content management system for my Jekyll powered blog hosted by Github Pages.</p>

<p>My Jekyll blog is generated on my machine, and then the generated site is pushed to my Github repo on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch via a <code>rake</code> task.</p>

<p>A separate task is also available to push the source to the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<p>My basic CMS is powered by PHP from my home server and is accessible from anywhere I have internet!</p>

<p>Testing save to drafts -> posts -> publish</p>

<p>Ran into some issues, hopefully this all works now.</p>

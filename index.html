	<div class="entry"><p>So we took little man to his first month check up this morning. He is 9 pounds 2 ounces and 20.5 inches long, or tall, I don't know what you classify a baby's length as yet... either way he is about 2 pounds bigger and about an inch longer than he was when he was born.</p>

<p>The doctor said Ayden is exactly where he is supposed to be and that he looks perfectly fine! Woohoo!</p>

<p>We have been dealing with some pretty bad monkey butt, but we are starting to get it under control and it's looking much better! It has gone from big, raised, red spots to almost nothing now! The secret: butt cream mixed with a liquid antacid!</p>

<p>He is still a little fussy and the doctor said it is probably due to reflux, so starting today we've been giving him baby Zantac. No updates on whether that's the case or if that's working yet, but we'll see!</p>

<p>He's a bundle of joy that we're more than excited to have! Yes it's a burden, but one that neither of us cares to carry!</p>

	<div class="entry"><p>Testing my very basic content management system for my Jekyll powered blog hosted by Github Pages.</p>

<p>My Jekyll blog is generated on my machine, and then the generated site is pushed to my Github repo on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch via a <code>rake</code> task.</p>

<p>A separate task is also available to push the source to the <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<p>My basic CMS is powered by PHP from my home server and is accessible from anywhere I have internet!</p>

<p>Testing save to drafts -> posts -> publish</p>

<p>Ran into some issues, hopefully this all works now.</p>

	<div class="entry"><p>Our day started pretty early, actually it started yesterday when we first arrived at the hospital around 9pm.
Kaci's water broke around 8:30pm and we loaded up and headed to the hospital! From then on it was a waiting game,
which seemed to progress very slowly. Until around 3:45am when the contractions started coming pretty quickly. A
little after 4am she started pushing! After a very short labor period and one tired mommy later Ayden Beckett Roy
entered into this world at 4:36am on March 17th, 2015 at an even 7 pounds!</p>

	<div class="entry"><p>We went to the hospital Saturday morning around 6am. Her mucus plug had come out.</p>

<p>No problems on Sunday.</p>

<p>Today, Kaci got ready and went to work as usual. She left work around 10am due to cramps and contractions. They started get worse around 5pm. I left work after closing the store at 7:30 and got stuck in some road work traffic on 75 north. Finally get home and leave again shortly after to fill her car up with gas and clean it out. Not five minutes later, her mom calls and tells me Kaci's water just broke!</p>

<p>So after the pump finished I hurried home and loaded the car with our packed bags, car seat, and wife!</p>

<p>We've now been at the hospital for two hours, and she's gotten her epidural already. Now we just wait for little man to join us! He's going to be a leprechaun!</p>
